Hy, Peace be upon you,

This repository contains the code, dataset links, and demo video for the paper:
"PowerLine-MTYOLO: A Multitask YOLO Model for Simultaneous Cable Segmentation and Broken Strands Detection", currently under submission to MDPI Drones.

# üìú Abstract

Power transmission infrastructure requires continuous inspection to prevent faults and ensure grid stability. UAV-based systems, enhanced with deep learning, have emerged as an efficient alternative to traditional, labor-intensive inspection methods. However, existing approaches typically rely on separate models for cable segmentation and anomaly detection, increasing computational overhead and reducing reliability in real-time applications.

To address these limitations, we propose PowerLine-MTYOLO, a lightweight, one-stage multitask model designed for simultaneous power cable segmentation and broken strand detection from UAV imagery. Built upon the A-YOLOM architecture and leveraging the YOLOv8 foundation, our model introduces four specialized modules‚ÄîSDPM, HAD, EFR, and Shape-Aware WiseIoU loss‚Äîto improve geometric understanding, structural consistency, and bounding box precision.

We also release the Merged Public Power Cable Dataset (MPCD), a diverse open-source dataset tailored for multitask training and evaluation. Experimental results show that PowerLine-MTYOLO achieves up to +10.68% mAP50 and +1.7% IoU over A-YOLOM, while outperforming recent YOLO-based detectors in both accuracy and efficiency. These gains are achieved with a smaller model footprint and the same inference speed as A-YOLOM. By unifying detection and seg-25 mentation into a single framework, PowerLine-MTYOLO offers an interesting solution for 26 autonomous aerial inspection and provides a foundation for future advancements in fine-27 structure monitoring tasks.

 # üé• Video Demonstration

The UAV footage shown in the demo video was not included in the training dataset (MPCD). This "unseen data" was used exclusively for visual evaluation, demonstrating PowerLine-MTYOLO‚Äôs ability to generalize to new and diverse real-world inspection scenarios.
